# Charlie Meyer's Personal Website!

This is the repository for my personal website, [charliemeyer.xyz](https://charliemeyer.xyz). I won't explain too much about it, since you can check it out yourself! If you're interested in how I hosted it and set up the email service, read the "projects" page. 

You may notice that the deployments say "pending." That's because I un-deployed it from GitHub, as i think it's so much better at [charliemeyer.xyz](https://charliemeyer.xyz) rather than having it say something like charliemeyer2000.github.io/website. Bleh.
