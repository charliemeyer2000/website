# Charlie Meyer's Personal Website!

This is the repository for my personal website, [charliemeyer.xyz](https://charliemeyer.xyz). I won't explain too much about it, since you can check it out yourself! If you're interested in how I hosted it and set up the email service, read about it in the "projects" page. 

You may notice that the deployments say "pending" or "error" or something. That's because I un-deployed it from GitHub, as i think it's so much better at [charliemeyer.xyz](https://charliemeyer.xyz) rather than having it say something like charliemeyer2000.github.io/website. Bleh. You still may be able to see deployments though, but images and stuff won't load because the filestystem where i hold svgs and other images is fit for the Ubuntu server i'm hosting the website on, not for github.
