<h1>Charlie Meyer</h1>

<h2 id="about">about</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm Charlie Meyer, an aspiring programmer/developer from Washington, D.C., currently completing undergraduate studies in computer science at UVA. I'm into weightlifting, skateboarding, and embroidery, and have a passion for automating small things in my life with my Raspberry Pi. </p>
<p>I started programming in middle school when my parents purchased me a Raspberry Pi, and I'm now taking introductory computer sciences courses at UVA, including a data structures and discrete mathematics class. I have now dabbled with many languages and frameworks. I'm relatively competent in Python and Java, and I've used JavaScript, C++, and C on occasion. Additionally, I've used Django, React, Git, and Figma recently to start building full web applications. </p>
<p>Outside of my coding, I'm a huge Model UN nerd. I started MUN in my sophomore year of high school when a friend "encouraged" me to try public speaking. Even though I sucked, I loved it. I'm keeping up my passion in college through UVA's International Relations Organization (IRO) which runs a MUN team, among other things. I've even become treasurer for the Organization and worked on a website for them. I attended UNCMUNC, UNC's MUN conference, and plan to attend many more to say I gavelled in the college MUN circuit - the dream of every person alive.</p>
<p>I started weightlifting over quarantine as we all did, but I still keep it up to this day. Forever chasing a 1,000 lb total, I've found weightlifting to be an enjoyable pastime that betters me. I also picked up skateboarding over quarantine, although my interest has waned through many ankle injuries. At my peak, I could 360-flip and kickflip and hold my own in a game of park S.K.A.T.E., but my talents and muscle memory are fading quicker as college classes & clubs have taken up a lot of that time.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by and reading this - that's pretty rad. </p>
